          Marie Skłodowska was born in Warsaw, Poland, to a family of teachers
          who believed strongly in education. She moved to Paris to continue her
          studies and there met Pierre Curie, who became both her husband and
          colleague in the field of radioactivity. The couple later shared the
          1903 Nobel Prize in Physics. Marie was widowed in 1906, but continued
          the couple's work and went on to become the first person ever to be
          awarded two Nobel Prizes. During World War I, Curie organized mobile
          X-ray teams. The Curies' daughter, Irene, was also jointly awarded the
          Nobel Prize in Chemistry alongside her husband, Frederic Joliot

          After Marie and Pierre Curie first discovered the radioactive elements
          polonium and radium, Marie continued to investigate their properties.
          In 1910 she successfully produced radium as a pure metal, which proved
          the new element's existence beyond a doubt. She also documented the
          properties of the radioactive elements and their compounds.
          Radioactive compounds became important as sources of radiation in both
          scientific experiments and in the field of medicine, where they are
          used to treat tumors.
